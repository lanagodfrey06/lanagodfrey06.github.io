# 👋 Hi, I’m Lana

I’m a Computer Science student at Loughborough University with a strong interest in web development, UX-focused design, and building practical, real-world systems.

This portfolio showcases a curated selection of my university coursework and personal projects. My work ranges from full-stack web applications and database-driven systems to frontend mock websites designed for independent cafés. I enjoy working across the full development lifecycle — from understanding user needs and designing intuitive interfaces, to implementing reliable backend logic and databases.

Alongside my academic work, I like creating personal projects that solve everyday problems or improve existing experiences, particularly for small businesses with outdated or poorly designed websites.
